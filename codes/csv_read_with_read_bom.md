This Ruby code reads data from a CSV file named 'file.csv'. Let's break down each part:

1. `CSV.read('file.csv', 'r:BOM|UTF-8', headers: true)`: This function call reads the CSV file named 'file.csv'. The second argument `'r:BOM|UTF-8'` specifies the file mode. It tells Ruby to read the file with UTF-8 encoding and to handle a Byte Order Mark (BOM) if present. The option `headers: true` indicates that the first row of the CSV file contains headers, and thus should be treated as such.

2. `.map(&:to_h)`: This part applies the `to_h` method to each row of the CSV data. The `to_h` method converts an array of key-value pairs into a hash. By using `&:to_h`, it's using Ruby's shorthand syntax to call `to_h` on each row of the CSV data. This effectively converts each row of the CSV into a hash where the keys are the headers from the CSV file.

In summary, this code reads a CSV file, assumes the first row contains headers, and converts each row of the CSV data into a hash, with the headers as keys.
