This Ruby code reads data from a CSV file named 'file.csv'. Let me break it down step by step:

1. `CSV.read('file.csv', encoding: 'BOM|UTF-8', headers: true)`: This line uses the `CSV.read` method to read the contents of the CSV file named 'file.csv'. It specifies two options:
   - `encoding: 'BOM|UTF-8'`: This specifies the encoding of the CSV file. It indicates that the file is UTF-8 encoded and includes a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning.
   - `headers: true`: This option indicates that the first row of the CSV file contains headers, which will be used to create keys for the resulting data structure.

2. `.map(&:to_h)`: This part of the code is using the `map` method to transform each row of the CSV data into a hash. `&:to_h` is shorthand for calling the `to_h` method on each row. The `to_h` method converts an array of key-value pairs into a hash where the first element of each pair becomes a key and the second becomes its corresponding value.

In summary, this code reads a CSV file, assumes it's UTF-8 encoded with a BOM, interprets the first row as headers, and converts each row of data into a hash where the keys are the header names.
