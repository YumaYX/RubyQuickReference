This Ruby code demonstrates different ways to create arrays:

1. ` %w(a b c #{str})`: Creates an array of strings without interpolation.
2. ` %Wa b c #{str})`: Similar to the first, but using an uppercase letter for the delimiter, creating an array with strings and interpolated variable.
3. `%i(a b c #{str})`: Creates an array of symbols without interpolation.
4. `%I(a b c #{str})`: Similar to the third, but with interpolation, creating an array of symbols with the value of the variable.
