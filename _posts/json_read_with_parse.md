This Ruby code performs the following tasks:

1. It requires the 'json' library, which is a standard library in Ruby for parsing and generating JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.

2. It reads the contents of a file named 'file.json' using the `File.read` method. This method reads the entire contents of the file as a string.

3. It then parses the JSON content using `JSON.parse`. This method takes a JSON string as input and converts it into a Ruby data structure, typically a hash or an array, depending on the JSON structure.

So, in summary, this code reads the contents of a JSON file named 'file.json' and converts it into a Ruby data structure for further processing within the Ruby program.
