This Ruby code uses the 'json' library to convert a hash (key-value pair) into a JSON format and then writes it to a file named 'file.json'. The hash contains a single key-value pair, where the key is ":key" and the value is "'value'". The File.open block ensures the JSON representation of the hash is dumped into the specified file in write ('w') mode.
