This Ruby code snippet reads data from a CSV file named 'file.csv'. Let's break it down step by step:

1. `require 'csv'`: This line imports the CSV library, which provides functionality for reading and writing CSV files in Ruby.

2. `CSV.read('file.csv', encoding: "BOM|UTF-8", headers: true)`: This line reads the CSV file named 'file.csv'. The `encoding: "BOM|UTF-8"` argument specifies the encoding of the file, ensuring proper handling of UTF-8 characters with a Byte Order Mark (BOM) if present. The `headers: true` argument indicates that the first row of the CSV file contains headers.

3. `.map(&:to_h)`: This part of the code uses `map` to iterate over each row of the CSV data and convert it to a hash. `&:to_h` is shorthand for passing the `to_h` method as a block to `map`, which converts each row to a hash where the keys are the header names and the values are the corresponding row values.

So, overall, this code reads data from a CSV file, interprets the first row as headers, and returns an array of hashes where each hash represents a row of data with the headers as keys.
