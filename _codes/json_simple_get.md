This Ruby code fetches book information from an API using an ISBN and parses the JSON response into a Ruby hash. It starts by importing the `net/http` and `json` libraries to handle HTTP requests and JSON parsing. The API URL, which includes the ISBN `9784791765553`, is defined as a string. This URL string is then parsed into a URI object. An HTTP GET request is made to this URI, and the response, which is in JSON format, is stored as a string. Finally, the JSON string is parsed into a Ruby hash for easy access and manipulation of the book data.
