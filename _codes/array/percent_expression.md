This Ruby code demonstrates different ways to create arrays:

1. `%w(a b c "#{str}")`: Creates an array of strings using whitespace as a delimiter, treating the elements as single-quoted strings except for the interpolation of the variable `str`.

2. `%W(a b c "#{str}")`: Similar to the previous one but allows interpolation and double-quoted strings.

3. `%i(a b c "#{str}")`: Creates an array of symbols, where each element is a symbol, and interpolation is not performed.

4. `%I(a b c "#{str}")`: Similar to the previous one but allows interpolation.

In summary, these variations provide flexibility in creating arrays with different types of elements and string interpolation.
