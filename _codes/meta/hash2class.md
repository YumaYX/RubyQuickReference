The Ruby code uses metaprogramming to create a dynamic class based on a hash. It defines a method create_dynamic_class that takes a hash and generates a new class. This class has attributes corresponding to the hash keys, with getter and setter methods, and an initializer that sets these attributes using the hash's values. When you create an instance of this class, it automatically has the properties defined by the original hash (e.g., name, age, city).
