The provided Ruby code reads lines from two text files and compares them to find matching lines. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation without using code:

1. **Read Lines from First File:**
   The code reads each line from a file named `file_each_line_b.txt` one by one.

2. **Nested Reading from Second File:**
   For each line read from `file_each_line_b.txt`, it reads through every line of another file named `file_each_line_a.txt`.

3. **Comparison of Lines:**
   It compares each line from `file_each_line_b.txt` with each line from `file_each_line_a.txt`.

4. **Output Matches:**
   If it finds a match between a line in `file_each_line_b.txt` and a line in `file_each_line_a.txt`, it prints the matching line to the console prefixed with "MATCHED:".

5. **Stop Further Comparison on Match:**
   After finding a match for a line from `file_each_line_b.txt`, it stops comparing that particular line with the remaining lines in `file_each_line_a.txt` and moves to the next line in `file_each_line_b.txt`.

6. **Repeat Process:**
   This process repeats for each line in `file_each_line_b.txt` until all lines have been compared.

In essence, the code is looking for common lines between the two files and outputs those lines when a match is found, avoiding redundant comparisons once a match is detected for a specific line.
