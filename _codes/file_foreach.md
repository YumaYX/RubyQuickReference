This Ruby code snippet reads and processes the contents of two files, `file_foreach_b.txt` and `file_foreach_a.txt`. It works as follows:

1. It opens `file_foreach_b.txt` and iterates through each line in the file.
2. For each line from `file_foreach_b.txt`, it opens `file_foreach_a.txt` and iterates through its lines.
3. During this nested iteration, it compares the current line from `file_foreach_b.txt` with each line from `file_foreach_a.txt`.
4. If it finds a matching line in both files (i.e., the lines are identical), it prints a message indicating that a match was found, including the matched line.
5. Once a match is found, it stops checking further lines in `file_foreach_a.txt` for the current line from `file_foreach_b.txt` and moves on to the next line from `file_foreach_b.txt`.

Essentially, this code checks for common lines between the two files and reports each match.
